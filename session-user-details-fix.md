# Testing Session User Details Loading

## Issue Fixed
When loading a session from history, user details were not being restored in the upload modal form.

## Solution Implemented
Updated `upload_modal.tsx` to:
1. Import `useEffect` hook
2. Access `currentSession` from session context  
3. Pre-populate form fields when modal opens and session has user details
4. Reset to empty if session has no user details

## How to Test

### Test 1: Create Session with User Details
1. Start new session in chat
2. Open upload modal and fill in user details (name, age, income, etc.)
3. Submit the form
4. Continue chat conversation
5. Save session via hamburger menu
6. Go to history page - verify session shows user details

### Test 2: Load Session and Verify Details
1. From history page, click on the saved session
2. Click "Load Session" 
3. Go back to chat page
4. Open upload modal via main page or any trigger
5. **Expected**: Form should be pre-populated with saved user details
6. **Previous Issue**: Form was showing empty fields

### Test 3: Session Without Details
1. Create new session
2. Chat without entering user details
3. Save session
4. Load this session
5. Open upload modal
6. **Expected**: Form should be empty (as no details were saved)

## Code Changes Made

### Added to upload_modal.tsx:
```tsx
// Added currentSession to context
const { updateUserDetails, currentSession } = useSession();

// Added useEffect to pre-populate form
useEffect(() => {
  if (isOpen && currentSession.userDetails) {
    setFormData({
      fullName: currentSession.userDetails.fullName || '',
      age: currentSession.userDetails.age || '',
      // ... other fields
    });
  } else if (isOpen && !currentSession.userDetails) {
    // Reset to empty if no user details
    setFormData({
      fullName: '',
      age: '',
      // ... other fields  
    });
  }
}, [isOpen, currentSession.userDetails]);
```

## Expected Behavior Now
✅ **New Session**: Upload modal shows empty form
✅ **Session with Details**: Upload modal pre-populated with saved details  
✅ **Load from History**: All user details restored and accessible
✅ **Update Details**: Can modify pre-populated details and save
✅ **No Data Loss**: User information preserved across save/load cycles
